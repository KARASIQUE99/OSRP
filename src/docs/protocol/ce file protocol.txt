.ce file stands for chemical element description
first 6 rows gives information about name, symbol, number, electron configuration
and atomic weight of naturally occurred mix of isotopes
after stated 5 rows of general information there's going a table of isotopes
which contain information represented as:
NUMBER=Z;N;MASS;DECAY PERIOD;DECAY TYPE;DAUGHTER ISOTOPE;SPIN

if there are many unstable isotopes of given element, in this table must be
stated either the ones that have decay period over 1 yr, or if there are not any
the most stable isotope of given element

for hydrogen .ce file will contain information given below:

name=hydrogen
symbol=H
number=1
configuration=1s1
weight=1.00811
1=1;0;1.007825031898;stable;none;none;0.5+;
2=1;1;2.014101777844;stable;none;none;1+;
3=1;2;3.016049281321;12.32y;b-;He-3;0.5+;
